# Project Zero: Tic Tac Toe
## Design and coded by Carmen Minikus

*Tic Tac Toe is a two player game, which two player alternates in placing symbols into a boxes within a grid space. The first user to have their symbol 3 in a row wins the game.*

The Tic Tac Toe game in this code allows users to choose between a green worm-like lama that is running backwards, or a galactic lama flashing in rainbow colors.

The first player gets to choose the their symbol, and once they start pressing into the grid the symbols alternate for the second user to play.

Once any user has got 3 symbols in a row, an animated bounce up score board will display the image of the winning user, and the total score of three games between the two users. After each win, the reset button will need to be pressed to clear the board for the next game.

If the game is a draw, a prompt (using Sweet Alert) will indicate that the game is a draw, and that the reset button will need to be pressed.
